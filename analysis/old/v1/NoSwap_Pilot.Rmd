```{r}
df_NM = read.csv("Data/NS_NM_Pilot.csv")
df_M = read.csv("Data/NS_M_Pilot.csv")

```

### Mean rt and accuracy of pilot data (Non-Mult and Mult trials)
```{r}
mean(df_NM$rt)
mean(df_NM$accuracy)

mean(df_M$rt)
mean(df_M$accuracy)
min(df_M$accuracy)
sd(df_M$accuracy)

mean(df_M$finalEarnings)

subject_means <- group_by(df_M, subject) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(earnings = max(earnings, na.rm = T))
mean(subject_means$earnings)
subject_means
```

### Test to see likelihood someone scoring 70% came from pilot population
```{r}

load("Data/S_M_raw.Rdata")

# Subject 4: 69/3% accuracy
df_70 <- S_M_raw[(S_M_raw$subject == 4),]

t.test(df_M$correct, df_70$correct)
```
